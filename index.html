        <h1>Jefferson Chen</h1>
        <p>I’m Jefferson Chen, an undergraduate at UC San Diego pursuing a double major in Business Economics and Data Science. As a leader in the UCSD Chinese Student and Scholar Association’s Academic Department, I enjoy organizing impactful academic and career-sharing events. My academic interests include predictive modeling, data analysis, and AI applications, and I’ve worked on projects involving technologies like reinforcement learning and scRNA-seq analysis tools. I’m passionate about using data-driven insights to create innovative solutions, and I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate and make meaningful contributions in both academic and professional settings.</p>
